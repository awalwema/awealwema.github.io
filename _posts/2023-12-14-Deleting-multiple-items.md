## Maximize Your Productivity with ClipPilot’s New Bulk Delete Feature

> **Important Update:** MacClipboard has been rebranded to ClipPilot, your enhanced clipboard management tool for macOS.

**Cleanup Your Clipboard Workspace**: ClipPilot is capable of storing up to 1000 items. But, managing these many items can sometimes be challenging. In response, we’ve developed the Bulk Delete feature. Designed to ease efficient clipboard management.

**Use 'Delete All Except Favorites':** This feature is for decluttering your clipboard without losing your essential, bookmarked items. It purges your clipboard, maintaining only your favorites.

**How to Utilize the Bulk Delete Feature**:

1. Right-click on the trash icon alongside any item in your clipboard.

2. From the context menu, select "Delete All Except Favorites".

3. For safety, ClipPilot will confirm your decision to delete.

**Video Guide for Bulk Delete**: Check out the video below to see how Bulk Delete works.
