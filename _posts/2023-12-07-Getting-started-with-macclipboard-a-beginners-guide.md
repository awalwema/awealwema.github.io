**Safeguard Your Sensitive Data**: ClipPilot provides enhanced privacy features. By default, the app excludes Keychain from app monitoring for you. This ensures your most confidential data, such as passwords and certificates remain private. For other privacy-sensitive applications, like third-party password managers, you can also exclude them. Navigate to settings, select 'Add Application to Ignore,' and choose the apps you wish to keep private. Removing apps from the ignore list is also straightforward – just click the red minus button next to the app.
