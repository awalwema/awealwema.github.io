# How to Copy and Paste text and images on Your Mac

Stepping into the world of Mac for the first time can feel daunting, especially when it comes to essential tasks like copying and pasting. This guide is crafted with you in mind, to make these steps feel like second nature.

## Your Step-by-Step Guide to Copying and Pasting Text

**Step 1: Selecting Your Text**

First, highlight the text you wish to copy. This can be done by clicking and dragging your cursor across the desired text. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut by holding Shift + Arrow Keys to select text efficiently.

**Quick Tip**: For cutting text, press Command + X instead of C, removing it from its original location as you copy.

**Step 2: Initiate the Copy**
