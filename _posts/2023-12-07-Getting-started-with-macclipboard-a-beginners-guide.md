**Safeguard Your Sensitive Data**: MacClipboard provides enhanced privacy features, including the automatic exclusion of certain sensitive applications, like Keychain, from clipboard monitoring. This ensures your most confidential data, such as passwords and secure notes, remain private. For other privacy-sensitive applications, especially third-party password managers, you have the flexibility to manually exclude them. Simply navigate to settings, select 'Add Application to Ignore,' and choose the apps you wish to keep private. Conversely, if you decide to reinstate monitoring for any app, removing it from the ignore list is straightforward – just click the red minus button next to the app.
